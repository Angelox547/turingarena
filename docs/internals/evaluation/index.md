# Submission evaluation

A **submission** is a *collection of one or more files*
that should be evaluated.
An **evaluation** consists of *text* and/or *structured data*.
An **evaluator** is a *program* which evaluates a submission
and produces an evaluation as output.

For algorithmic problems, a submission is usually a single file
containing the source code of the solution,
and possibly another file whose content specifies the programming language used.
However, it is possible for a submission to contain more than one file,
for example if the different files are written by different people
and should be evaluated one against the other
(e.g., bots in a two-player game).

TuringArena defines exactly what submission and evaluations are,
and how they should be represented.
